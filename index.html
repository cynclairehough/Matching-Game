card 2: higher-order function) 
(card 3: math.random(); card 4: returns a random number between 0 and 1)
(card 17: initialization; 
card 18: This expression runs before the execution of the first loop, and is usually used to create a counter.)

types: (card 9: returns true or false; card 10: boolean) 
(card 11: while (condition) {
  // statement
}; card 12: while loop) (card 19: let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    console.log(i);
}; card 20: infinite loop)

outputs: (card 5: math.floor(1 + 0.5); card 6: 1) (card 7: 'Cynclaire Hough'.length; card 8: 15)
(card 13: const myArray = [];
let i = 10; card 14: Output: 10) (card 15: const arr = [ "Ashley", "Michael", "Cody" ];
