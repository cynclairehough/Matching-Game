1. Why do we create .js file instead of typing js in the index under <script> tags?
2. The disconnect is how html is being incorporated with the javascript code and how to put javascript into divs then style it with css
Do not understand why indivdual divs in html are not needed for card boxes.
Do not understand the order of the script in js and why certain script cannot be placed before others.
Not sure what the card array should look like. Should I have all of the words to the card listed
Do not understand the class card and card constructor
